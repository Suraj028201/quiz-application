I have added three component in the project
1) A login component, where user will have to enetr his email id, and he can also read instruction regarding quiz. He can visit dashboard page only if he logins otherwise not as route guard has been added here.

2) A dashboard component, where user can see questions one by one, he can navigate to next question by clicking the next button or the question number column at the left. Answeres question button will be green, visited will be yellow and not visited button will be white. There is timer at the top which will start as soon as user lands on dashboard and quiz will get autosubmitted when timer becomes zero. User can submot the assignment by clicking on submit assignment button also.

3) A report compoent, where user can see his score and questions details as per assignment requirement, one change correct aswer background will be green so it will be easy for user.
